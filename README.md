# malware-samples
This repository contains samples of malware. These samples were collected from WHM/cPanel servers and accounts,
most of which have not been recognized by antivirus providers.
Furthermore, the majority of the websites were flagged as spam, phishing, or malware, and were subsequently restricted by Google
and various blacklisting companies. 

Within this repository, I am sharing some of my past experiences and operations involving 
malware removal,
security checks, and the delisting of websites.
